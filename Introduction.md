This report summarizes the analysis of the Iowa Liquor Sales dataset (2012-2020). The objective was to identify the most popular item per zipcode and the percentage of sales per store from 2016-2019.
The analysis involved data extraction, transformation, and visualization using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Data Extraction
We queried the database to retrieve liquor sales data between 2016 and 2019 and exported the results to a CSV file for further analysis.

Data Transformation
Using Pandas, we performed the following transformations:
1. Filtering the data for the years 2016-2019.
2. Grouping and Aggregating to find the total bottles sold per item per zipcode.
3. Calculating Percentages of sales per store.

Data Visualization
Two primary visualizations were created:
1. Bar Plot: Most Popular Items per Zipcode
2. Pie Chart: Sales per Store

Conclusion
The analysis revealed the most popular liquor items per zipcode and the sales distribution across stores.
The visualizations effectively communicate the findings, providing insights into consumer preferences and sales performance in different areas.
